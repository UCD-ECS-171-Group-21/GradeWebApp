# GradeWebApp
Welcome to Group 21's repository, containing all deliverables (except for the final report) for the ECS 171 (Fall 2023 Cohort).

In this repository, you will find the following folders:
- **Grade Web App**: This folder contains all the files necessary to locally host our web demo of the Random Forest Regressor. Inside, you will find a formatted, one-hot-encoded dataset for testing our model.
- **Datasets**: This folder houses all iterations of our datasets, which are dependencies for our .ipynb notebooks. It includes our initial dataset 'student-por.csv', on which we performed PCA and one-hot-encoding, resulting in 'student-por-PCA.csv'. This is the final dataset used to train our models.
- **Figures**: Here are all the figures and metrics utilized during the development of our models.
- **Models**: Contains all the models and notebooks developed throughout this project. 'random forest.ipynb' is our final model.

**IMPORTANT NOTICE**
Please ensure that you have the following packages installed for everything to function correctly:
